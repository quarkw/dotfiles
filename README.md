# Quark's Dotfiles

## Installation

## History

I started these dotfiles when getting an M1 macbook, so I wouldn't have to deal with apple-silicon compatability with my previous dotfiles

Some goals of these dotfiles:
- Have an automated way of updating them so I don't have to maintain as much
- Modularity, inspired by doom-emacs, so it's easier to train different configurations
- Idempotency: Running scripts from dotfiles shouldn't add duplicate lines to ?*sh configuration
